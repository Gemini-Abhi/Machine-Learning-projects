# Credit Card Applicant Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for a capstone project in which I was tasked with analyzing a customer dataset provided by a financial institution to assess the creditworthiness of potential credit card applicants. The project involved comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and encoding to prepare the dataset for analysis. Additionally, I developed a supervised machine learning model to predict credit card eligibility, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of approximately 99%.

## Dataset

The dataset, named `Credit_Card.csv`, contains the following features:

- **Ind_ID**: Client ID
- **Gender**: Gender information
- **Car_owner**: Whether the individual owns a car or not
- **Property_owner**: Whether the individual owns property or not
- **Children**: Count of children
- **Annual_income**: Annual income
- **Type_Income**: Income type
- **Education**: Education level
- **Marital_status**: Marital status
- **Housing_type**: Housing style
- **Birthday_count**: Backward count from the current day (0), where -1 means yesterday
- **Employed_days**: Backward count from the current day (0) as the start date of employment, with positive values indicating unemployment
- **Mobile_phone**: Presence of any mobile phone
- **Work_phone**: Presence of any work phone
- **Phone**: Presence of any phone number
- **EMAIL_ID**: Presence of any email ID
- **Type_Occupation**: Occupation
- **Family_Members**: Family size

## Results

The following machine learning models were employed to predict credit card eligibility, along with their respective accuracy percentages:

- **Logistic Regression**: 98.63%
- **Decision Tree**: 100.00%
- **XG Boost**: 99.73%
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: 92.08%
- **Random Forest**: 100.00%

## Conclusion

This project not only provided valuable insights into the bank's credit card approval process but also highlighted the key features that play a pivotal role in determining credit card eligibility. The high accuracy rates achieved by the models demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis and modeling techniques employed.
