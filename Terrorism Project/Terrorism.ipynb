    "***Over the years, the world has encountered a dual challenge, grappling with both natural and man-made calamities. A recent survey reveals that annually, an alarming 218 million individuals bear the brunt of these disasters, leading to a devastating loss of around 68,000 lives. Despite the consistent occurrence of natural disasters like earthquakes and volcanoes, a troubling pattern unfolds globally â€” a continuous rise in the frequency of terrorist activities over the years.***"
